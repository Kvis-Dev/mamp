## intro
This set of scripts is written to manage webserver on mac. It was inspired by denwer and openserver.
I want to create a set of scripts that woud do all the dirty job for you, because setting it all up is really annoying.

## features
 - Uses brew to manage packages, so the size of this scripts is not very big.

## requirements
 - Python 3
 - [brew](https://brew.sh/)


## installation
Just clone this repository anywhere you want.

## usage

sudo python3 main.py [start|stop|status|restart|wizard]


 * sudo python3 main.py start - starts all the services
 * sudo python3 main.py stop - stops all the services
 * sudo python3 main.py status - prints the status of all services
 * sudo python3 main.py restart - restarts all the services
 * sudo python3 main.py wizard - starts a wizard that helps you create a local domain. You just answer a few questions and voila! all done!
